KeyLogDaemon
============
Commonly, Hooking of password window was prevented. 

But build the extended kernel so that it is possible to hook the all key event.

This project consists of 2 parts.

That is, project for making the extended kernel file and projec on application level.

The extended kernel file hook the user key event.

The app make the log file from sync with daemon.

Thank you.
